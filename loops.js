/*1. For Loop
This loop runs a set number of times.*/

// Syntax:

// for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
//     // Code to be executed
// }


// for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
//   console.log(i);
// }



/*2. While Loop
This loop continues to execute as long as the condition remains true.

while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}*/

// let i = 1;
// while (i <= 5) {
//   console.log(i);
//   i++;
// }



/*3. Do...While Loop
This loop will execute the code at least once, even if the condition is false.

Syntax:

do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
*/


// let i = 1;
// do {
//   console.log(i);
//   i++;
// } while (i <= 5);



/*Key Differences Between Loops
Loop Type	When to Use
for loop	When you know how many times you need to run the loop.
while loop	When you donâ€™t know how many times the loop should run, but it depends on a condition.
do...while loop	When you want to run the code at least once before checking the condition.*/
